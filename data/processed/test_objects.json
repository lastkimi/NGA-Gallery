    "provenance": "By 1808 in the collection of Alexis-François Artaud de Montor [1772-1849], Paris, who probably purchased the panels during one of his several periods of residence in Italy;[1] (his estate sale, Seigneur and Schroth at Hotel des Ventes Mobilières, Paris, 16-17 January 1851, nos. 35, 36, and 39 [with 1937.1.2.a and .b, as by Margaritone d’Arezzo]); Julien Gréau [1810-1895], Troyes; by inheritance to his daughter, Marie, comtesse Bertrand de Broussillion, Paris;[2] purchased September 1919 by (Duveen Brothers, Inc., Paris, New York, and London);[3] Carl W. Hamilton [1886-1967], New York, by 1920;[4] returned to (Duveen Brothers, Inc.); sold 15 December 1936 to The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[5] gift 1937 to NGA. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On Artaud de Montor, apart from the unpublished doctoral dissertation of Roland Beyer for the University of Strasbourg in 1978, see Jacques Perot, \"Canova et les diplomates français à Rome. François Cacault et Alexis Artaud de Montor,” _Bullettin de la Société de l’Histoire de l’Art français_ (1980): 219- 233, and Andrea Staderini, “Un contesto per la collezione di primitivi di Alexis - François Artaud de Montor (1772-1849),” _Proporzioni. Annali della Fondazione Roberto Longhi_ 5 (2004): 23-62.\r\n\r\n[2] This information on the post-Artaud de Montor provenance of the work was gleaned at the time Duveen Brothers, Inc., purchased the three panels. See the Duveen prospectus, in NGA curatorial files; Edward Fowles, _Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 116.\r\n\r\n[3] Fowles 1976, 116; Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: reel 85, box 230, folder 25, and reel 422. The Duveen record indicates that they purchased the painting in Paris from Hilaire Gréau, a son of Julien Gréau.\r\n\r\n[4] The three panels were exhibited as “lent by Carl W. Hamilton” in the New York exhibition in 1920. Fern Rusk Shapley (_Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:134) also states that they were formerly in the Hamilton collection, and it is reported that “the Cimabue altarpiece was seen in Hamilton’s New York apartment” by 1920 (see Colin Simpson, _Artfull Partners. Bernard Berenson and Joseph Duveen_, New York, 1986: 199). However, this and other pictures had actually been given to Hamilton on credit by Duveen Brothers (see Meryle Secrest, _Duveen. A Life in Art_, New York,  2004: 422) and were probably returned to the dealers by 1924, when they were shown as \"lent anonymously\" at the exhibition of early Italian paintings in American collections held by the Duveen Galleries in New York.\r\n\r\n[5] The original bill of sale is in Records of The A.W.

    "provenance": "The often-repeated statement in the earlier literature that the panel comes from the Florentine monastery of San Felice in Piazza[1] does not seem to be based on any secure, or at any rate documented, evidence. Perhaps more plausible, based at least on the identity of the saint, is the more recent proposal of a provenance either from the Florentine Ospedale di San Paolo or from the nearby church of San Paolino, since a handwritten annotation on an old photograph indicated its provenance “dai padri di San Paolino.”[2] Elia Volpi [1858–1938], Florence, by the early 1900s;[3] (his sale, American Art Galleries, New York, 21-27 November 1916, seventh day, no. 1040, as “Primitive school of Tuscany, early XVth century”); (Bourgeois Galleries, New York);[4] purchased January 1920 by (Duveen Brothers, Inc. London, Paris, and New York);[5] sold 15 December 1936 to The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[6] gift 1937 to NGA.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In the introduction to the 1916 sale catalogue (n.p.), Elia Volpi states that among his pictures which “belong . . . to the School of Italian Primitives, the majority . . . [come] from the sacristy of the convent of St. Felice in Florence.” On this basis both Venturi and several other later authors claimed that the NGA _Saint Paul_ formerly belonged to that church; however, as Lucia Meoni has (1993) pointed out, “nessuna fonte antica o le schede del Carocci testimoniano l’antica collocazione del San Paolo nella chiesa di San Felice. . . .” (\"No early source nor the entries in Carocci's Inventory [an inventory compiled in 1892 on behalf of the Soprintendenza of Florence] record the presence of the _Saint Paul_ in the church of San Felice...\"). Roberta Ferrazza (_Palazzo Davanzati e le collezioni di Elia Volpi_, Florence, 1993: 216 n. 52) has found records of sales of art objects from the Conservatorio di San Pier Martire, annexed to the church of San Felice, in the years between 1884 and 1901, as well as a note in the photo archive of the Biblioteca Berenson at I Tatti (Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, Florence), according to which Stephan Bourgeois, who bought the panel now in Washington at the Volpi sale, “went to see Mr. Guglielmetti, Mr. Volpi’s secretary, from whom he [Bourgeois] received the information that Mr. Volpi [said he had] bought the picture in 1907 from the administrators of the Monastery of S. Felice in Florence. . . .” NGA systematic catalogue author Miklós Boskovits is inclined, however, to think that the records of Volpi’s secretary were based on the same rather vague memories and should not be considered trustworthy.\r\n\r\n[2] According to the unpublished research of Kathleen Giles Arthur (c. 1991; copy in NGA curatorial files) “the Saint Paul most probably was commissioned by one of the major charitable institutions in fourteenth century Florence,” i.e., the Ospedale di San Paolo, and the worshippers of the saint can be identified as the members of the third order of Saint Francis, lay men and women who formed the staff of the hospital. The claim, however, is no more than speculation on the part of the author. The provenance from San Paolino, on the other hand, is asserted by a handwritten note on the reverse of an early photograph in the photo archive of Federico Zeri in Bologna (no. PI 0044/2/32; originally taken c. 1910 apparently by the firm Brogi in Florence); see also Miklós Boskovits, _A Critical and Historical Corpus of Florentine Painting. The fourteenth century, The Painters of the Miniaturist Tendency_, Sec.III, Vol. IX, Florence,1984: 350 n. 3). San Paolino (originally San Paolo), in the Quartiere Santa Maria Novella, was already a collegiate church in the eleventh century and, after various vicissitudes, was sold to the discalced Carmelites in 1618; they rebuilt the church in its present form later in the seventeenth century and still officiate it. After the suppression of religious orders in 1808, the friars had to abandon the church and its annexed convent, but it was restored to them in 1814, and they remained there until a second suppression of the convent in 1866 (Osanna Fantozzi Micali and Piero Rosselli, _Le soppressioni dei conventi a Firenze_, Montelupo Fiorentino, 2000: 233). Since the late nineteenth century, however, the church has once again been officiated by the discalced Carmelites; see Walter and Elisabeth Paatz, _Die Kirchen von Florenz. Ein kunstgeschichtliches Handbuch_, Vols. 1-6, Frankfurt am Main, 1940-1953: 4(1952): 591. There is no documentation of any confraternity dedicated to Saint Paul that met in this church, but the large group of donors at the foot of the NGA panel suggests that a lay confraternity commissioned it. It is known, on the other hand, that Daddi did work for San Paolino: another painting by him, representing the _Madonna and Child_ and now in the Galleria dell’Accademia (no. 3466; see Angelo Tartuferi in _Cataloghi della Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze. Vol. 1: Dipinti_, ed. Miklós Boskovits and Angelo Tartuferi, Florence, 2003: 60-63), also comes from this church and can be assumed to be close in date to the Gallery's painting.\r\n\r\n[3] After an early career as a painter and restorer, Volpi began to work as an art dealer in Città di Castello towards the end of the nineteenth century. He then moved to Florence, where he purchased the Palazzo Davanzati in 1904 and transformed it into a private museum, furnishing it with paintings and _objets d’art_ from his collection. The museum was opened to the public in September 1910. Presumably by then the panel discussed here was already in Volpi’s possession; the Volpi sale catalogue of 1916 noted that it had come from the Palazzo Davanzati. Luigi Coletti (“Il Maestro colorista di Assisi,” _Critica d'Arte_ 8-9 (1949-1950): 447) claims that the painting passed through the hands of the dealer Stefano Bardini (1836–1922), but Everett Fahy’s research (_L’Archivio storico fotografico di Stefano Bardini. Dipinti, disegni, miniature, stampe_, Florence, 2000) does not confirm this.\r\n\r\n[4]  A copy of the sale catalogue in the NGA library is annotated with the Bourgeois name, which is also given in the Duveen prospectus (in NGA curatorial files). See Osvald Sirén, “A great contemporary of Giotto – I,” _The Burlington Magazine_ 35 (December 1919): 229; Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 152; and note 1 above.\r\n\r\n[5]  Boskovits 1984, 349-350, and Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: reel 422; reel 45, box 133, folder 1; reel 101, box 246, folder 4; copies from the Duveen records in NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n[6] The original bill of sale is in Records of The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Subject Files, Box 2, Gallery Archives, NGA; copy in NGA curatorial files. The painting is attributed to Giotto, with a parenthetical note stating that Bernard Berenson gives it to Daddi. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "provenance": "Probably in the sacristy of the church of San Miniato al Monte, Florence, from whence the triptych may have been removed shortly after 1830.[1] Bertram Ashburnham [1797-1878], 4th earl of Ashburnham, Ashburnham Place, Battle, Sussex;[2] by inheritance to his son, Bertram Ashburnham [1840-1913], 5th earl of Ashburnham, Ashburnham Place; by inheritance to his daughter, Lady Mary Catherine Charlotte Ashburnham [1890-1953], Ashburnham Place; (Robert Langton Douglas, London);[3] purchased 19 June 1919 by (Duveen Brothers, Inc., London, New York, and Paris);[4] sold 15 December 1936 to The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[5] gift 1937 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Miklós Boskovits, _Pittura fiorentina alla vigilia del Rinascimento, 1370-1400_, Florence, 1975: 118-121, proposed this provenance. The Alberti family were patrons of the church, and Benedetto di Nerozzo Alberti left funds for its decoration in a codicil dated 1387 that was appended to his will of 1377 (now lost and known only from a seventeenth-century abstract); see Luigi Passerini, _Gli Alberti di Firenze. Genealogia, storia e documenti_, Florence, 1869: 2:187. Three of the four saints depicted in the side panels are associated with the Alberti family, providing further argument in support of the proposed provenance. Although in 1975 Boskovits erroneously asserted that Saint John Gualbert was represented in the altarpiece to the right of the Virgin, he corrected this in the NGA systematic catalogue by identifying the saint instead as Bernard of Clairvaux, the patron saint of Benedetto Alberti's son Bernardo, who in his will dated 1389 left money for masses to be celebrated annually for his soul in the family chapel in San Miniato, which had evidently already been consecrated (see Stefan Weppelmann, _Spinello Aretino_, Florence,  2003: 381). The representation of Saint Andrew, who was the patron saint of a predeceased son of Benedetto Albert also links the altarpiece to the sacristy of San Miniato, and Catherine of Alexandria, shown standing on a broken wheel, was evidently much venerated in the Alberti family. In Benedetto's will he bequeathed money for the decoration of an oratory near Florence (Santa Caterina dell'Antella) dedicated to Catherine, and his son, Bernardo, wished to build a monastery and a church in her honor (see Weppelmann 2003).\r\n\r\n      Although this provenance remains a hypothesis, it still seems a quite plausible one that, if correct, would provide the certainty that by 1830 the altarpiece was still on the altar of the sacristy. An altarpiece can apparently be seen still in place in a sketch of the sacristy's altar wall made in that year by Christoph Roller (1805-1858), in his _Tagebuch einer italienschen Reise_ (Burgdorfer Heimatsmuseum, Burgdorf, Switzerland). Unfortunately, the sketch, kindly brought to the attention of Miklós Boskovits by Stefan Weppelmann, is very small and not sufficient for identifying the Gallery's painting. What may be said for certain is only that an altarpiece composed of five panels stood on the altar of the sacristy of San Miniato in 1830, but by 1836 this altarpiece was no longer there (Weppelmann 2003, 184). It was removed and sold, presumably by the Pia Opera degli Esercizi Spirituali, which had owned the furniture and decorations of the church since 1820; see \"Regesto dell' Abbazia florentina di S. Miniato,\" _La Graticola_ 4 (1976): 117-135.\r\n\r\n[2] The collection, formed originally by George, 3rd earl of Ashburnham, was enlarged by his son, Bertram, after whose death no further paintings were added. See _The Ashburnham Collections. Part I. Catalogue of Paintings and Drawings ..._, Sotheby’s, London, sale of 24 June 1953: 3-4. \r\n\r\n[3] According to Denis Sutton (“Robert Langton Douglas. Part III,” _ Apollo_ 109 (1979): 452, Douglas was in contact with the Ashburnham family around 1919. See also letter from Douglas to Fowles dated 1 May 1941, Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: box 244, reel 299.\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: reel 422.

Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[10] gift 1937 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to evidence collected by the Duveen Brothers (see prospectus in NGA curatorial files and also the statement published in _Duveen Pictures in Public Collections of America_, New York, 1941: no. 55), the portrait was \"said traditionally to be a member of the Del Nero family\" and came from the collection of Baron Cerbone Del Nero. So far no supporting evidence has emerged to confirm this tradition, which was probably passed on to Duveen Brothers by the Torrigiani family; nonetheless, at least as far as the provenance is concerned, this appears plausible. In any case, the Galleria Torrigiani (see below), where the painting is recorded for the first time by the mid-nineteenth century (see Otto Mündler, \"The Travel Diaries of Otto Mündler, 1855-1858,\" ed. Carol Togneri Dowd, in _Walpole Society_ 51 [1985]: 132), was in the palace originally belonging to the Del Nero family. Old guides to Florence do not mention a Palazzo Torrigiani or family collections. Palazzo del Nero, instead, built around the middle of the sixteenth century on Baccio d'Agnolo's design, is listed as early as 1591 by Francesco Bocchi (_Le bellezze della città di Firenze_, ed. Giovanni Cinelli, Florence, 1677 [originally 1591]: 288-290, reprinted Bologna, 1973), who also records some valuable Renaissance paintings housed there. The palace also represented an important cultural point of reference, as it was the headquarters of the Accademia degli Alterati, founded in 1568.  Along with the meetings of the Academy, the building housed an important collection of antiques and works of art, which in 1715 numbered some one hundred pieces (see Leonardo Ginori Lisci, _I palazzi di Firenze_, 2 vols., Florence, 1972: 2:675-682, and Liliano Gregori's unpublished 1993 Ph.D. dissertation for Università Cattolica, Milan, on the library of the Del Nero family). Carlo, born in 1433 and still living in 1477, was a champion of humanistic interests in the family and active in economic and political life; owing to his artistic sensibility he could possibly be the sitter in the portrait. The family died out at the beginning of the nineteenth century with Cerbone, baron of Porcigliano (see Agostino Ademollo, _Marietta de' Ricci ovvero Firenze al tempo dell'assedio_, 2nd ed. by Luigi Passerini, 6 vols., Florence, 1845: 4:1341-1344 n. 10). At his widow's death, their property passed to her brother, Pietro Torrigiani (see Luigi Passerini, _Genealogia e storia della famiglia Guadagnia_, Florence, 1873: pl. VII between pp. 148 and 149).\r\n\r\n[2] In 1795 Pietro, the second child of Giambattista Guadagni, became the heir of his uncle, Cardinal Luigi Torrigiani, whose last name he assumed.  See Passerini, _Genealogia e storia_, 1873: 153-158.\r\n\r\n[3] The creator of the Gallery was probably Luigi Torrigiani, described as \"un appassionato per le belle arti\" who \"arricchi di preziosi capolavori la pinacoteca della famiglia\" (\"an afficionado of the fine arts who enriched the family collection with precious masterpieces\"; see Passerini, _Genealogia e storia_, 1873: 159), adding to the works already in Palazzo Del Nero those coming from his family and from its inheritances from the Santini and Minerbetti (see Ginori Lisci, _Palazzi di Firenze_, 1972: 679), as well as the Pazzi families (see Pompeo Litta, _Familglie celebri italiane_, 2nd ser., vol. 5 [n.d., but 1851]: \"Pazzi,\" pl. X). Only in the late 1840s do Florentine guides begin to mention a Galleria Torrigiani, describing some of its artistic treasures (see Federico Fantozzi, _Nuova guida ovvero descrizione storico-artistico-critica della città e dei contorni di Firenze_, Florence, 1841: 600-601; Giuseppe François, _Nuova guida della città di Firenze_, Florence, 1850: 549). Otto Mündler visited the collection in September 1856 and described the painting: \"Portrait of a man, by Pollajuolo (?), It has a good deal of A. Verocchio and of L. di Credi. Backgroun, sky, very much injured.\" See \"The Travel Diaries of Otto Mündler 1855-1858,\" ed. Carol Togneri Dowd, _Walpole Society_ 51 (1985): 132, 310. Sir Charles Eastlake, director of London's National Gallery, also saw the painting in 1856, describing it as follows: \"Portrait - man - hair close to brow - hand - lk red dress - sky in up. Part darkened - probably Verrocchio - suffered\" (Susanna Avery-Quash, \"The Travel Diaries of Sir Charles Eastlake,\" 2 vols., _Walpole Society_ 73 [2011]: 1:311; kindly brought to the Gallery's attention by Alexander Röstel, curatorial fellow, National Gallery, London, e-mail of 12 February 2019, in NGA curatorial files).\r\n\r\n[4] Only specific archival research could establish exactly how the contents of the gallery were divided among Luigi Torrigiani's four sons, Pietro, Filippo, Raffaele, and Carlo. According to information gathered by Duveen Brothers, however (see note 1), the painting belonged to Raffaele.\r\n\r\n[5] According to the widow of Luigi Torrigiani, it was the decision of his four sons to break up the family gallery (see Elisa Torrigiani, _Mon journal_, Florence, 1905: 409-410). It seems that, as early as the 1860s, negotiations were begun with antique dealers and agents in the city for the sale of some of the works (see John Fleming, \"Art Dealing in the Risorgimento,\" _The Burlington Magazine_ 121 [1979]: 576). Nonetheless, only in 1896 were some paintings sold, including two _cassone_ panels by Pesellino with stories from the life of David, now in the National Gallery in London (see _Catalogue of Pictures forming the Collection of Lord and Lady Wantage_, London, 1902: 113-119) and stories from the life of Esther by Filippino Lippi, purchased for the collection of the princes of Liechtenstein in the same year and in more recent times sold to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa; see Myron Laskin, Jr., and Michael Pantazzi, _Catalogue of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.  European and American Painting, Sculpture and Decorative Arts_, 2 vols., Ottawa, 1987: 1:167-169. Probably in the same year the NGA painting also changed hands; however, while the Ottawa panels were sold through Stefano Bardini, the NGA painting, according to the Getty Provenance Index, was acquired by Kann through Agnew's and Charles Fairfax Murray. The painting was Agnew's stock number 7624.\r\n\r\n[6] See Wilhelm von Bode, _Die Gemälde-Galerie des Herrn Rudolf Kann in Paris_, Vienna, 1901: 27-28; Emile Michel, \"La Galerie de M. Rodolphe Kahn[_sic_]-2,\" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ 3e, 43 (1901): 496.\r\n\r\n[7] See Edward Fowles, _Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 35-42.\r\n\r\n[8] As can be seen from correspondence between Bernard Berenson and Isabella Stewart Gardner (and in particular a letter from Berenson dated 4 August 1907), J.P. Morgan purchased the entire Kann collection as a block, with the intention of keeping for himself only some thirty paintings. Mrs. Gardner, with Berenson's encouragement, tried to obtain the NGA painting for her collection, but was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n[9] Not officially announced, in the early months of 1935 news nonetheless began to spread of the sale of a certain number of paintings belonging to the Morgan collection (see \"Morgan Sales,\" _Art Digest_ 9 [February 1935]: 18; \"Morgan Sale,\" _Art Digest_ 9 [July 1935]: 22; _Pantheon_ 15 [April 1935]: 116).  Messrs. Knoedler & Co. were entrusted with the sale; the Getty Provenance Index provides the information that the painting was Knoedler's number CA 765 (see T.L.H., \"Masterpieces from the Morgan Collection Sold,\" _Apollo_ 21 [1935]: 167). It does not appear that Wildenstein & Co. was involved, as Shapley asserts (Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:128).\r\n\r\n[10] Mellon purchase date and date deeded to Mellon Trust are according to Mellon collection files in NGA curatorial records and David Finley's notebook (donated to the National Gallery of Art in 1977, now in the Gallery Archives).",

This may be the picture sold with part of the Orléans collection in London in April 1793, no. 49, for 15 guineas, as a self-portrait by Mor; see Gustav Friedrich Waagen, _Treasures of Art in Great Britain...._, 4 vols.

However, there are a number of discrepancies between Dubois de Saint-Gelais' relatively precise description and the Gallery's painting.  Thus Dubois de Saint-Gelais does not mention chains of honor, sword, or dagger, but does describe a signet ring on the hand resting on the dog's collar.

Martha Hepworth's letter of 2 August 1988 to Susan E. Davis, in NGA curaorial files, notes that this is a later annotation by Frank Simpson, Librarian at the Barber Institute.

Burroughs of the Metropolitan Museum (archival envelope, _Apotheosis of Francesco Barbaro_, Metropolitan Museum, New York). Lattimer was the cousin of Ralph Curtis, then owner of the palace, and found this information in files assembled at the palazzo by Mrs. Curtis.\r\n\r\n[2] According to marginal notations in the sale catalogue housed in the Frick Art Reference Library, New York.\r\n\r\n[3] According to marginal notations in the Knoedler Fiche copy of the sale catalogue; Cammondo is not named anywhere on the catalogue, but Lugt, vol. 4, No. 51324, lists this as Cammondo's sale. Féral, named as a painter and authority for the paintings included in the sale, may have been acting as agent for Baron Adolph de Rothschild, who is said in a prospectus from the Bachstitz Gallery (in NGA curatorial files; see also note 4) to have purchased the painting at the Cammondo sale.\r\n\r\n[4] The prospectus from the Bachstitz Gallery, in NGA curatorial files, states that the painting was presented by Baron Adolphe (_sic_) von Rothschild of Paris to his daughter on the occasion of her marriage to a Baron von Springer of Vienna, and was subsequently purchased from Baron von Springer's estate by Dr. Kranz. However, Baron Adolphe, though married, died childless. The Getty Provenance Index suggested instead (letter of 15 March 1993 from Martha Hepworth to Eric Garberson, NGA curatorial files) that the painting passed to Adolphe's niece, Valentine Noémi de Rothschild (1886-1969), who in 1911 married Baron Sigismund von Springer (1875-1928), but the painting was already in the collection of Dr. Kranz by 1902.\r\n\r\n[5] Catalogued by Heinrich Modern, _Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.

This publication cannot be located, but is cited in Tancred Borenius, \"The Stefan von Auspitz Collection\", _Burlington Magazine_ 61 (1932): 283-288. Borenius 1932: 287, noted that the dissolution of the Auspitz collection in 1932 was necessitated by the Austrian financial crisis of 1931.\r\n\r\n[7] _Bulletin of the Bachstitz Gallery_ 1935: 22. When the von Auspitz collection was liquidated in 1932 some or all of it was sold through Bachstitz, while some was acquired by collector Daniel George von Beuningen, and consigned for sale to Bachstitz. The Tiepolo was with Bachstitz by c. 1932, according to a letter inquiring about the painting dated 18 April 1933 from the firm of Jacques Seligmann, New York (Seligmann papers, Archives of American Art, Box 11, copy NGA curatorial files).\r\n\r\n[8] See also The Kress Collection Digital Archive, https://kress.nga.gov/Detail/objects/1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Walter W. S. Cook, \"Spanish Paintings in the National Gallery of Art,\" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_, XXVIII (1945): 79, said that the portrait was \"acquired in 1677 in Madrid,\" while José López-Rey, _Velázquez. A Catalogue Raisonné of His Oeuvre_, (London, 1963): 316, stated that it was purchased in 1687.  José Gudiol, _Velázquez_ (1974): 150, suggested that Count Harrach bought the painting in 1687.  In his 1926 catalogue for the Harrach collection (_Katalog der Erlaucht Gräflich Harrach'schen Gemäldegalerie in Wien_), Hermann Ritschl noted that Count Harrach mentioned the painting in a 1690 document as \"ein Contrefait, Bruckstück von einem Mann im grauen Wamms mit dunklen Ermeln, kleinen Überschlag mit Spitzen, von Velasca.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See entry from the David Finley notebook, as well as the 30 May 1988 letter from Dr. Robert Keyszelitz of the Gallerie Harrach (both in NGA curatorial files).  Although the Finley entry identifies the owner as \"Harrach (Count Johann von H.),\" Keyszelitz states in his letter that when the painting was sold to Duveen's in 1930, Count Otto Harrach was the head of the family.  Upon his death in 1935, his son Count Johann inherited this position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] The original Duveen Brothers invoice is in Gallery Archives, copy in NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n",

Knoedler & Co., London and New York);[9] sold 7 February 1922 to Andrew W. Mellon, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.;[10] deeded December 1934 to The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[11] gift 1937 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  The inventory of El Greco's estate made in 1614 includes the following item: \"Un S. ilefonso escribiendo\" (\"A Saint Ildefonso writing\"); see Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, _El Greco en Toledo_, Madrid, 1910: 193.\r\n\r\n[2]  The painting is listed in the inventory of 1621 as follows: \"Un san Ylefonso bestido de cardenal escribiendo, de bara y terzia de alto y casi un bara de ancho, con quadro dorado\" (\"A Saint Ildefonso dressed as a Cardinal writing, a _vara_ and a third in height and almost a _vara_ in width, with a gilded frame\"); see Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, \"De la vida del Greco,\" _Archivo Español de Arte y Arqueologia_ 3 (1927): 70, n. 15.  A _vara_, a traditional Spanish measurement, equals about 84 cm. Thus, the painting was said to be 112 cm tall and almost 84 cm wide.  \r\n\r\n[3]  _Relación del magestuoso recibimiento y entretenido cortejo de una fiesta de toros celebrada en honor de Carlos II y su esposa en Burguillos en una casa de recreación de D. Juan Varela Colima, secretario de S. M. y recaudador de los servicios de millones de Toledo y su partido...3 de junio de 1698_, Madrid, 1698. The relevant passage is transcribed in Francisco J. Sánchez Cantón, _Fuentes para la historia del arte español_, 5 vols., Seville and Madrid, 1923-1941: 5:509-510. The presentation is described as follows: \"A la Reina se ofrecieron doce albanicas de láminas primorísimas y al Rey una pintura de vara y media de alto, original del célebre Dominico Greco, que representaba a San Ildefonso con nuestra Señora, objectos predeilectísimos de la devoción de Carlos II...\" (\"To the Queen were presented twelve fans with exquisitely decorated blades and to the King a painting a _vara_ and one-half in height [i.e., about 126 cm tall], an original by the celebrated Dominico Greco, which depicts San Ildefonso with Our Lady, favored objects of devotion of Carlos II...\"). The NGA painting is the only work by El Greco or his workshop which corresponds to this description. \r\n\r\nThe painting is listed in the inventory of the collection at the Palacio Real, Madrid, made between 1701 and 1703, as follows:  \"Ytten otro lienzo de Vara y Quartta de altto y bara de Ancho poco mas de Un San Yldefonso escribiendo delantte de Una Ymagen de nuestra Señora y Un Retratto en el mismo lienzo del Griego todo tasado en treinto Doblones\" (\"And another painting one _vara_ and a quarter in height [i.e. c. 105 cm] and a little more than one _vara_ wide [i.e., c. 84 cm] of a Saint Ildefonso writing in front of an image of Our Lady and a portrait in the same painting [frame?] by Greco all valued at 30 _doblones_\"); see  _Inventarios reales: Testamentario del Rey Carlos II_, ed. by Gloria Fernández Bayton, 6 vols., Madrid, 1975-: 1(1701-1703):31, no. 130. \r\n     \r\nThis entry seems to refer to two separate paintings which had been enframed together. Double enframing was not common, but it was sometimes utilized in the collection of paintings at the Palacio Real in Madrid.  Among the 1,067 entries in the 1701-1703 inventory of the Madrid palace, there are five additional references to other small works enframed together.  \r\n\r\nIt is impossible to know what portrait was enframed with _Ildefonso_; the portrait might be a now-lost work. Nevertheless it is tempting to posit that the _Ildefonso_ was displayed with Greco's portrait of a Dominican or Trinitarian monk (now in the Prado). This is one of the few portraits by El Greco or his school that could be combined with the _Ildefonso_ without significantly exceeding the measurements given in the 1701-1703 inventory.  Because the subject of this portrait is a monk, the combination of this painting with the _Ildefonso_ would accord with the practice otherwise followed in the royal collection of jointly enframing thematically related works. \r\n\r\n[4] Manuel B. Cossío, _El Greco_, Madrid, 1908: 598-599, no. 299; and August L. Mayer, _Domenico Theotocopuli, El Greco_, Munich, 1926: 46, no. 287, maintained that Zacharie Astruc purchased the painting in Madrid and imported it to France. This is not possible if the painting was in the Condesa de Quinto's sale because Astruc made his first trip to Spain in 1864. See Sharon Fletcher, _Zacharie Astruc: Critic, Artist and Japoniste_, Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, New York, 1977 (published in the series, Outstanding Dissertations in the Fine Arts, New York, 1978): 305.  \r\n\r\n[5] The price is annotated in both the Frick Art Reference Library and the NGA copies of the sale catalogue.  \r\n\r\n[6] The price is annotated in the Frick Art Reference Library copy of the sale catalogue.\r\n\r\n[7] Ives, Colta et al. _The Private Collection of Edgar Degas: A Summary Catalogue_. New York, 1997: no. 599 give Durand-Ruel, who was an expert at the Millet sale, as the intermediary for Degas. \r\n\r\n[8] In the 1990 NGA systematic catalogue (Jonathan Brown and Richard G. Mann, _Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth through Nineteenth Centuries_, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, 1990: 44), the painting was incorrectly identified as lot number 3 in this sale, which was _Saint Dominique_, now owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, accession number 23.272 and identified as _Saint Dominic in Prayer_. Diana Kostyrko, e-mail of 18 March 2015, in NGA curatorial files, kindly pointed out the error. \r\n\r\n[9]  For an interesting account of Knoedler's purchase of this painting, see Sir Charles J. Holmes, _Self & Partners (Mostly Self)_, London, 1936: 335-340.\r\n\r\n[10] The date of purchase is noted in David Finley's notebook of Mellon acquisitions; original in NGA Gallery Archives, and copy in NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n[11] Mellon collection records in NGA curatorial files.",

X-401, identifies the NGA _Saint Martin and the Beggar_ as the one sold as part of the Baron Taylor collection.  The only information provided in the sale catalogue for lot 22 is the title and artist (El Greco). It is therefore impossible to identify which of the five small versions of _St. Martin and the Beggar_ was sold at the 1880 auction.  August L. Mayer, \"_St. Martin and the Beggar_ by El Greco,\" _Apollo_ 10 (1929):151 claims the the number \"387\" inscribed at the lower right indicates that the NGA painting was once in the Spanish royal collection, but he does not provide any evidence to support this assertion. The number 387 is not used to identify a painting of Saint Martin or a work of any subject by El Greco in the published inventories of the Spanish collections.

Mayer, _Domenico Theotocopuli, El Greco_ (Munich, 1926): 48, no. 299, claims that the painting was included in the auctions of the Manzi collection. However, it is not mentioned in the catalogues of the auctions of paintings from the Manzi collection held at Galérie Manzi, Joyant et Compagnie, Paris, 13-14 March 1919 and 13 December 1919, nor is it mentioned in contemporary articles on these auctions. See, e.g., Alexandre Arsene, \"Les collections Manzi,\" _Les Arts_ 5 (1919): 1-26.

Kress Foundation, New York;[6] gift 1939 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The first mention of the altarpiece is in Giorgio Vasari's _Vite_. \"Lorenzo Cossa\" (a conflation of Cossa and Lorenzo Costa), in the 1550 life of Cossa's student Ercole de' Roberti (\"Ercole Ferrarese\", Vasari, ed. R. Bettarini and P. Barocchi, 3, part 1, 1971: 420), notes \"E cosi in San Petronio, in una cappella, una tavola a tempera che si conosce a la maniera, con una predella sotto di figure piccole fatte con gran diligenzia\" (And likewise [he painted] in San Petronio, in a chapel, an altarpiece in tempera recognizale by its style, with a predella beneath of small figures done with great diligence). In the 1568 edition of the _Lives_ (ed. Rosanna Bettarini and Paola Barocchi, 8+ vols., Florence, 1966-: 3, part 1(1971):419-420), Vasari provides further information, noting that the chapel was dedicated to Saint Vincent and that the predella, which Vasari considered of higher quality than the rest of the altarpiece, was painted by Ercole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1568 edition includes a separate biography for \"Lorenzo Costa\" (the same Cossa-Costa conflation with a slightly different name) mentioning the chapel's donors, the Griffoni (Vasari, ed. Bettarini and Barocchi, 3, part 1, 1971: 415-416). That the Griffoni patron of the altarpiece was Floriano is demonstrated by a document of 19 July 1473 (_Archivio di San Petronio, Vacchetta di mandati_, VII, n. 413, c. 13t), cited by I.B. Supino, _L'arte nelle chiese di Bologna: secoli XV-XVI_, 2 vols., Bologna, 1932 and 1938: 2:196-199: \"Item, m. Augustino de Marchi de Crema, magistro lignaminis, libras sex quatrinorum pro capsa quam fecit circa tablum altaris Floriani de Grifonibus; promiserunt Officiales ei donare.\" (Item, the officials promised to give to Messr. Agostino de Marchi of Crema, master woodworker, six lire, for the frame which he made around Floriano Griffoni's altarpiece). It was customary for an artist to undertake a large-scale painting after its frame had been made, so work on the altarpiece probably began after the woodcarver received payment for the frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attribution to Lorenzo Costa and association with Griffoni are also found in Pietro Lamo, _Graticola di Bologna, ossia descrizione delle pitture sculture e architteture di detta citta [c. 1560]_, Bologna, 1844: 39; Carlo Cesare Malvasia, _Pitture di Bologna_, Bologna, 1686: 242; Antonio di Paolo Masini, _Bologna perlustrata_, Bologna, 1666, 111, and _Pitture di Bologna_ (anonymous revision of Malvasia 1686), Bologna, 1706: 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] On 14 February 1725 the painter Stefano Orlandi wrote to Cardinal Pompeo Aldrovandi, to whom custody of the Griffoni chapel had passed (Daniele Benati, 1984, 193 note 26, and \"Per la recomposizione del polittico Griffoni,\" in _Da Borso a Cesare d'Este: La scuola di Ferrara, 1450-1628_, [exh. cat., Matthiesen Fine Art, Ltd., London], Ferrara, 1985: 172-174), \"Dal sig. Dottore Galimberti mi viene signigicato che vostra Signoria Illustrissima e Reverendissima sia per fare dipingere nella sua capella in San Petrino l'ornamento del altare...per ciò ò stimato bene presentarli un piccolo abozo della forma che si ritrova la tavola di detta altare a ciò veda, che per fare un ornamento moderno, quello non potria servire in nisuna forma...\" (from Dr. Galimberti I understand that Your Reverence wishes to have decoration for the altar of your chapel in San Petronio painted...thus I have thought well to present to you a small sketch of the altarpiece so that you will see that it will not serve in any form to make modern ornamentation).  Orlandi's suggestion to remove the altarpiece seems to have been carried out shortly before 22 October 1731, when Aldrovandi was sent a letter from his agent Angelo Fontana (Benati, see above), which reads in part \"In ordine poi al dipinto, che stava all'Altare nella Cappella in S. Petronio non mancarò d'abboccarmi col Sig. Maccaferri per ridurre quello in tanti quadretti nella miglior forma, che si potrà, supponendo voglia farli ornare concornici proprie per campagna...\" (As for the painting that was on the altar in the chapel in S.  Petronio, I won't fail to speak with Sig. Maccaferri about reducing it into so many small pieces in the best possible shape, supposing a desire to ornament them with frames appropriate for the countryside...).  The Griffoni altarpiece was no longer included in the _Pitture di Bologna_ of 1732. The 1776 edition of _Pitture, scolture ed architetture...di Bologna..._, 215, notes decoration by Orlandi and Vittorio Bigari in the chapel (\"Cospi, non più Griffoni\") and continues: \"La Tavola del Costa, colle storiette d'Ercole da Ferrara notate dal Vasari furono trasportate in Casa Aldrovandi allorchè il Cardinal Pompeo Aldrovandi successore de' Griffoni fece ridurre questa Cappella come al presente, prima di cambiarla colla Casa Cospi...\" (Costa's [sic] altarpiece, along with the little stories by Ercole of Ferrara noted by Vasari, were transported to the Casa Aldrovandi when Cardinal Pompeo Aldrovandi, successor of the Griffoni, had the chapel reduced to its present form, before exchanging it with the Cospi family). An inventory of the Casa Aldrovandi in 1782 (Ms. B104, Biblioteca dell'Archiginnasio, Bologna) does not include any pictures that could come from the Griffoni altarpiece, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] The presence of _Saint Florian_ and the companion _Saint Lucy_ (NGA 1939.1.228) in the Beni collection is noted in a diary entry of 3 June 1858 by Otto Mündler (cited in Martin Davies, _National Gallery Catalogues: The Earlier Italian Schools_, London, 1961:  152, note 16; see also Otto Mündler, _The Travel Diaries of Otto Mündler, 1855-1858_, ed. Carol Togneri Dowd, in _Walpole Society_ 51 (1985): 246-247, 268.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] The catalogue of the 1929 Spiridon collection sale indicates that both NGA paintings were purchased from Count Beni in Florence in 1881.  This contradicts the citation in Davies 1961: 152 n. 16, that refers to them as lots 4 and 5 in the \"Conte U. Beni\" sale of April/May 1882 in Gubbio. This sale catalogue is unlocated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] See Oskar Fischel, _Die Sammlung Joseph Spiridon_, Berlin, 1929: no. 12, repro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] The Duveen Brothers letter confirming the sale of thirteen paintings and one sculpture, including NGA 1939.1.227 and .228, which were described as \"representing 'St. Liberale' and 'St. Lucy', is dated 18 May 1939; the provenance is given as \"Spiridon Coll'n\" (copy in NGA curatorial files; Box 474, Folder 5, Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles).

The earliest direct reference to the _Aeneid_ scenes occurs in a somewhat garbled description by Giorgio Vasari in his _Life of Titian_ (1568): “Avendo l’anno 1514, il duca Alfonso da Ferrara fatto acconciare un camerino, ed in certi spartimenti fatto fare al Dosso, pittore ferrarese, istorie di Enea, di Marte e di Venere, et in una grotta Vulcano con due fabbri all fucina...” (“During the year 1514 Duke Alfonso of Ferrara caused to be decorated a small chamber, for which he commissioned the local painter Dosso to paint various compartments showing the stories of Aeneas, Mars and Venus, and in a grotto Vulcan with two smiths at the forge.”); Giorgio Vasari, _Le vite de’ più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori nelle redazioni del 1550 e 1568_, edited by Rosanna Bettarini and Paola Barocchi, 8 vols., Florence, 1966-1987: 6(1987):158. The ten scenes were, according to Peter Humfrey, almost certainly painted in 1520-1521 (Peter Humfrey, “More on Dosso’s _Aeneas_ Frieze,” _Artibus et Historiae_ 81 [2020]: 137-156). Humfrey’s article and Christie’s sale catalogue entry for the other half of the painting (22 April 2021, no. 22), provide much of the detail of this provenance; see also the following notes as well as correspondence with Humfrey dated 29 May 2021 in NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n[2] When Alfonso II d’Este died childless, his cousin Cesare d’Este (1562-1628) inherited Ferrara. However, Pope Clement VIII refused to recognize the legitimacy of his succession and instead absorbed the duchy into the Papal States in 1598. Cesare moved to Modena and never took possession of the paintings.\r\n\r\n[3] Writing to the Cardinal in March 1608 immediately before they were removed, the papal legate to Ferrara, Innocenzo Massimo, described the scenes as follows: “Et questi sono dieci pezzi che servono per fregio ad un Camerino; sono lunghi ogni pezzo una Canna et alto tre palmi rappresentano diverse azioni d’Enea, scritte da Virgilio sono bellissimi.” (“These consist of ten pieces forming the frieze of a small chamber; each is one canna wide by three palmi high; they represent different deeds by Aeneas, as recounted by Virgil; and they are very beautiful”.) See Amalia Mezzetti, “Le ‘Storie di Enea’ del Dosso nel ‘camerino d’alabastro’di Alfonso I d’Este,” _Paragone_ nos. 189–190 (1965): 82. One _canna architettonica romana_, comprising 10 _palmi architettonici_, was equivalent to 2.234 m; one _canna mercantile romana_, comprising 8 _palmi mercantile_, was equivalent to 1.992 m. Whichever method of measurement was adopted here, it is clear that the dimensions given by Massimo are only very approximate.\r\n\r\n[4] This painting and NGA 2021.6.1, still joined, may almost certainly be identified with an item recorded in the Borghese inventory of 1693, which included the ten paintings of the series described vaguely in terms of dimensions and subjects. This half of the painting was previously mistakenly identified as no. 390 in the inventory. Instead, as noted in Christie’s 2021 sale catalogue (see note 1), the painting in its original format is probably no. 192, described as “…un quadro longo con paesi e Marine con figure e vascello del No 2 del Dosi de ferrara con cornice dorata\" (…an oblong painting with landscape and seascape, figures, and a vessel, by Dosso of Ferrara, belonging to no. 2, in a gilded frame). See P. Della Pergola, “L’inventario Borghese del 1693,” _Arte Antica e Moderna_, no. 26 (1964): 218-230, no. 28 (1964):451-467, no. 30 (1965):202-217; cited in Humfrey 2020: 155 n. 8. The NGA painting is listed in issue no. 28 (1964): 452, no. 192. As Humfrey notes, the frieze canvases are no longer mentioned in a Borghese inventory of c. 1790.\r\n\r\n[5] For details of the Princes of Sulmona (Borghese) lineage, see the entry for lot 22 (NGA 2021.6.1) in Christie's 2021 sale catalogue.\r\n\r\n[6] A multi-volume dictionary from 1847 lists the uncut painting as among the ten canvases from Dosso’s frieze acquired by Madrazo from the Borghese princes in Rome. (Vincenzo Farinella, _Alfonso I d’Este. Le immagini e il potere_, Milan, 2014: 505-506, n. 60). It is likely to be no. 7, titled “Recompocision que hacen los Frigios de sus naves” (The Phrygians [Trojans] repairing their ships).  D. José Rojas, ed., _Diccionari geográfico-estadistico-histórico de España y su posesiones de Ultramar por Pascual Madoz_, X, Madrid, 1847, p. 860. The dictionary provides no dimensions, but they are given in an 1856 catalogue of the Madrazo collection. Renato Berzaghi, “Una segnalazione per le ‘Storie di Enea’ di Dosso Dossi,” _Prospettiva_, nos. 139/140 (2010): 135-136; cited in Humfrey 2020: 155 n.7. Madrazo, a Spanish neoclassical painter and later director of the Prado, spent the years from 1803 to 1819 in Rome. The 1856 catalogue confirms their presence in his collection in Madrid at that date, as well as the earlier Borghese provenance, and provides exact dimensions, detailed descriptions of the subjects, and the books of _The Aeneid_ from which they are taken. The NGA paintings, still intact, are listed as no. 77, 59 x 183 cm, the subject taken from Book V: “Reparans los Troyanos sus naves en la ribera del mar junta á un grupo de árboles” (The Trojans repairing their ships on the seashore near a group of trees), which places the scene in Sicily (Humfrey 2020: 142-143).\r\n\r\n[7] The 1861 date purchase date comes from the provenance of 2021.6.1 as relayed by Christie's 2021 sale catalogue. The still-intact painting, with dimensions of .59  x 1.83 m and same title as in the 1856 Madrazo catalogue cited in footnote 6, is included in the 1865 catalogue of the Marqués de Salamanca's collection of paintings, no. 77. Copy in NGA curatorial files. \r\n\r\n[8] The transfer from Hans Wendland to the Kunsthandel AG Lucerne, founded by Julius Böhler, and then to Contini-Bonacossi, is recorded in records of Julius Böhler held at the Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte, Munich. See inventory cards digitized at http://boehler.zikg.eu/karteikarten-bersicht. (Copies in NGA curatorial files). Dimensions on the cards indicate the canvas was cut by 1925.\r\n\r\n[9] According to Kress records in NGA curatorial files.

Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[3] inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Leone Vicchi, _Dieci quadri della Galleria Sciarra_, Rome, 1889: cat. 1, first reproduced the painting, then in the Colonna di Sciarra collection. That the painting had been in the Barberini collection, part of which went to the Colonna di Sciarra (see Dennis Mahon, \"Fresh Light on Caravaggio's Earliest Period: His 'Cardsharps' Recovered,\" _The Burlington Magazine_ 130, no. 1018 [January 1988]: 17-18), is proven by its apparent inclusion in seventeenth-century Barberini inventories (Marilyn A.  Lavin, _Seventeenth-Century Barberini Documents and Inventories of Art_, New York, 1975: 298, 338, 442, cats. IV. inv. 71.138, IV. hered. 72.59, VI. inv. 92-04.365). A 1671 inventory made at the death of Cardinal Antonio Barberini includes the following description of a male portrait: \"Un altro [ritratto] d'Un huomo Armato con Berrettone rosso in Capo di Andrea Mantegna\" (\"a portrait of an armed man with a large cap on his head by Andrea Mantegna\"). Another inventory of 1692-1704 gives the height of the same painting: \"Un altro [ritratto] di un huomo armato in Tavola con beretta rossa in Tela da tre p. mi.\" The description, the measurement (corresponding to about 68 cm.), and the attribution (matching the spurious inscription) all point to the Gallery's panel. If an entry in a 1641 Barberini inventory (Lavin 1975: 167, cat. IV. inv. 44.240) listing \"Un ritratto di un huomo armato, con una beretta rossa in testa, con cornice nera con filetti d'oro\" also refers to the painting, the inscription would presumably have been added in the middle years of the seventeenth century. The inheritance from Antonio to Carlo Barberini may have been through Antonio's brother, Francesco, who died in 1679.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] According to Mahon 1988: 19, Prince Sciarra had several of his paintings brought to Paris between December 1891 and January 1892. That the Gallery's \"Mantegna\" was among them is proven by a passage Mahon quotes from Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre, _Mémoires_, Paris, 1928: 1:132-133. Legal obstacles probably prevented Sciarra from selling the painting until 1895 or 1896 (Mahon 1988: 20).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] According to Widener collection records, in NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Johnson, Philadelphia; purchased 1894 by Peter A. B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[3] inheritance from Estate of Peter A. B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Catalogue of Paintings Forming the Private Collection of P.A.B. Widener, Ashbourne, near Philadelphia. Part II. Early English and Ancient Paintings_, Paris, 1885-1900: 202, gives the provenance as \"Ingram (Marsala House) Collection.\" A typewritten copy of the same catalogue, dated 1908 on the binding (NGA library, Rare Book Collection), changes \"Marsala\" to \"Matsala.\" Subsequent Widener catalogues (1916, 1923, and 1931) give the provenance as Matsala House. The probable pendant (see text of the NGA systematic catalogue entry) is listed in the _Catalogue of a Collection of Pictures Belonging to John G. Johnson_, Philadelphia, 1892: 86, no. 257, as coming from \"Ingram of Marsala House.\" Ingram has not been identified conclusively, but would appear to be John Ingram, who is known to have collected Guardi views in Venice around 1800. On John Ingram see Francis Haskell, \"Francesco Guardi as _Vedutista_ and  Some of His Patrons\", _Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes_ 23 (1960):  271-272.  In a letter of 17 September 1968 (NGA curatorial files), Haskell wrote that he was baffled by the reference to Matsala House. John Ingram is known to have resided at Staindrop Hall, County Durham; in Venice; and later in Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The later history of John Ingram's collection is traced by James Byam Shaw, \"Some Guardi Drawings Rediscovered\", _Master Drawings_ 15 (1977): 3-5. Parts of Ingram's collection were dispersed at the end of the nineteenth century in public sales that did not include paintings. Johnson may have acquired the Washington and Philadelphia paintings directly or indirectly from Ingram's heirs at about this time, but this cannot be documented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] According to a typewritten card in the Lynnewood Hall Inventories, NGA curatorial files.

William Ward, 1st earl of Dudley [1817-1885, created earl 1860], Witley Court, Worcestershire, by 1871; by inheritance to his son, William Humble Ward, 2nd earl of Dudley [1867-1932], Witley Court; (sale, Christie, Manson & Woods, London, 25 June 1892, no. 9); (P. & D. Colnaghi & Co., London);[5] sold 1894 to Peter A.B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; gift 1942 to NGA.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both Van Arnhem and Gockinga had individually offered to buy the two pictures by Hobbema, including NGA 1942.9.31, that Gosen Geurt Alberda van Dyksterhuys owned. Before either had closed the deal, however, the owner died. It was later arranged that the two would purchase the paintings together; see Charles J. Nieuwenhuys, _A Review of the Lives and Works of Some of the Most Eminent Painters_, London, 1834:147-149.\r\n\r\n[2] The catalogue of this sale bears the title _Catalogue d'une riche collection de tableaux des écoles flamande et hollandaise, recueillie par M. Héris de Bruxelles..._, but although the collection was \"recueillie\" (collected/gathered) by Héris and was offered for sale under his name, he may not himself have been the owner of the paintings.  In the copy of the sale catalogue at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the words \"Recueillie par M. Héris de Bruxelles\" in the title are followed by the handwritten addition, \"pour M. le Colonel Biré,\" and alongside the title in the Victoria and Albert Museum's copy is written \"mais c'est la collection de M. le Colonel Biré,\" which suggests that Héris may have been acting as Biré's agent in acquiring and selling the pictures.\r\n\r\n[3] The buyer's name is noted in the Philadelphia copy of the sale catalogue as \"hoppe,\" which is probably a misspelling of Hope. (The 1858 Hope sale catalogue states that Hope bought the picture at the Héris sale.)\r\n\r\n[4] Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, _A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch Painters of the Seventeenth Century..._, 8 vols., trans. by Edward G. Hawke, London, 1907-1927: 4:406, lists the 1849 sale in the provenance of his no. 100, a painting that may or may not be identical with his no. 94, 4:403-404 (which is definitely _The Travelers_).  The compositional descriptions given in both these Hofstede de Groot entries are similar, but the dimensions listed for no. 100, 51 x 54 inches, are impossible for the National Gallery picture. The identity and whereabouts of Hofstede de Groot no. 100 remain unclear; it is possible that Hofstede de Groot was mistaken in the dimensions that he gave for this picture, and that it was indeed the same painting as his no. 94. Hofstede de Groot further confuses the issue by listing part of the provenance of _The Travelers_ under no. 94, and part (the 1841 Héris sale) under no. 100. The 1849 Hope sale catalogue does not give dimensions, so it is impossible to establish whether the painting offered there was _The Travelers_ or the unknown, and perhaps apocryphal, \"Hofstede de Groot 100.\" The picture in question fetched £367.10, and Hofstede de Groot, citing as his source a handwritten note in Smith's own copy of his _Catalogue Raisonné_, says that it was bought in. (In this copy, which is at the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, The Hague, Smith gives the buyer as \"Fuller,\" but this is not necessarily contradictory, as Fuller may have been a Christie's employee.) Smith's statement is probably correct, for the National Gallery of Art's painting remained in the possession of W.W. Hope until 1858, when it was sold in Paris.\r\n\r\n[5] Colnaghi lent the painting to the Royal Academy of Art’s 1894 Winter Exhibition, which ran from January to March. The sale to Widener must have occurred later in the year. \r\n\r\n[6] A label from the Art Institute of Chicago shipping room, dated 27 January 1943, was removed from the painting’s stretcher in 1981, but neither the Art Institute nor the NGA registrar’s office records this movement. \r\n\r\n",

Hamilton [1886-1967], New York, by 1920, and returned 1921;[2] purchased c. 1923 by Joseph E. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[3] inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, after purchase by funds of the Estate; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The painting is first recorded in the Earl of Pembroke's collection at Wilton by C. Gambarini, _A Description of the Earl of Pembroke's Pictures_, Westminster, 1731: 93, no. 4. Johann David Passavant, _Tour of a German Artist in England_, English ed., 2 vols, London, 1836: 1:306, connected it with the mention of a painting of Judith by Raphael in Abraham van der Doort's 1639 inventory of the collection of King Charles I (published as Abraham van der Doort, _A Catalogue and Description of King Charles the First's Capital Collection of Pictures, Limnings, Statues, Bronzes, Medals, and Other Curiosities_, London, 1757), which was said to have been obtained in exchange for two works that had belonged to the Third Earl of Pembroke:  a portrait of a young woman and a religious work by Parmigianino. The Raphael Judith is thus mentioned twice in connection with these two other works. First it appears in item no. 15:  \"A moddest forward full-faced painted younge womans picture..., onely a head, halfe soe bigg as the life wch your-Matie togeither with the 2. Children of Permencius had in way of Exchange for the little Judith of Rafell Urbin when you were Prince of the late decd Lo: of Penbrooke Steward of your Mats houshould: painted upon the right light.\" The _Judith_ is mentioned again in item no. 26:  \"Item a peece of. 2. naked Children imbraceing one another signifying Christ and St John in-the desart said to bee don by Parmentius Chaunged by yor Maty with my Lo: Steward Pembrooke decd for a Judith beeing a little intire figure said to have been don by Raphael d'Urben...\" (quoted from Oliver Millar, \"Abraham van der Doort's Catalogue of the Collections of Charles I,\" _Walpole Society_ 37 (1960): 79, 81). But Millar 1960: 232, rejecting Passavant's identification, has suggested that the Judith in the inventory may be identifiable with Giorgione's well-known painting of the heroine in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe painting's inclusion in a 1992 exhibition about Lorenzo de' Medici's Giardino di San Marco reflected its occasional identification with a small panel painting of Judith by Mantegna, listed in the 1492 inventory of Lorenzo's collection. This work was similar in scale and function to NGA 1942.9.42, that is, \"una tavoletta [small panel] in una cassetta [box] dipinti su una Giudetta chon la testa d'Oloferno e una serva, opera d'Andrea Squarcione [i.e., Mantegna]\" (_Libro d'inventario_ 1992: 51). Paul Kristeller, _Andrea Mantegna_, trans. S. Arthur Strong, London and New York, 1901: 20-21, who did not regard the NGA painting as Mantegna's, listed Lorenzo's little panel of the same subject among the artist's lost or missing works. Lionello Venturi (_Pitture italiane in America_, Milan, 1931, and expanded English ed., _Italian Paintings in America_, trans. Countess van den Heuvel and Charles Marriott, 3 vols., New York and Milan, 1933: 2: pl. 340, note) first identified the NGA painting with Lorenzo's picture, and Hans Tietze (_Meisterwerke europäischer Malerei in Amerika_, Vienna, 1935: 328, and English ed., 1939: 312) followed suit. Though accepted hypothetically by Renata Cipriani, _Tutta la pittura del Mantegna_, 1st and 2nd ed., Milan, 1956: 60, and English ed., _All the Paintings of Mantegna_, trans. Paul Colacicchi, 2 vols., New York, 1963: 79, and by Rona Goffen in _Small Paintings of the Masters, Masterpieces Reproduced in Actual Size. Early Italian School_, ed. Leslie Shore, 3 vols., Redding, Connecticut, 1980: no. 30, the identification was rejected by Erika Tietze-Conrat, _Mantegna.  Paintings Drawings Engravings_, New York, 1955: 245; Niny Garavaglia, _L'opera completa del Mantegna_, Milan, 1967: 109-110; and Ronald Lightbown, _Mantegna_, Oxford, 1986: 435, cat. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The Getty Provenance Index provides the details about the listing in Agnew's stock. The entry for the painting in the Duveen Brothers Records has the following notations: \"1/2 share Scott Fowles,\" \"Sotheby 19/7/17,\" and \"Agnew 23/9/17\" (copy in NGA curatorial files; X Book, Reel 422, Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles). According to Edward Fowles (_Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 127-129), a large collection of Italian paintings was offered on approval to Hamilton by 1920, but he did not purchase them and returned them to Duveen the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Widener collection records, in NGA curatorial files, give a purchase date of c. 1921, but the Duveen Brothers Records list expenses for the painting into 1923, indicating they probably still had ownership until that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Fern Rusk Shapley (_Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:382 n. 8) speculates that the painting may have been among those confiscated from the Sforza family in Milan by King Louis XII of France in 1499. She cites as evidence an inventory of Italian portraits belonging to his queen, Anne de Bretagne, which includes an \"autre tableau sur boys peint d'une autre femme de Italie, ayant les cheveux troussés, et dessus ung chappelet faict en fasson de perles\" (Jean Adhémar, \"Une galerie de portraits italiens à Amboise en 1500,\" _Gazette des Beaux Arts_ 86, no. 1281 [October 1975]: 102). But the reference could describe any of a large number of portraits produced in Milan in the late fifteenth century. Nor can another reference--specifically to a portrait of Bianca Maria Sforza--be definitely connected with the NGA painting; the commentator, Marcantonio Michiel, describes, in the house of Taddeo Contarini in Venice in 1525, a \"retratto in profilo insino alle spalle de Madonna...fiola del signor Lodovico da Milano maritata nello Imperatore Massimiliano fu de mano de...Milanese\" (_Notizia d'opere di disegno_, 2nd rev. ed., ed Gustavo Frizzoni, Bologna, 1884: 166). But this portrait of Bianca Maria, whom Michiel wrongly identifies as Ludovico's daughter rather than his niece, is specifically said to be only bust-length (\"alle spalle\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "provenance": "Painted for Warren Hastings [1732-1818], Daylesford House, Gloucestershire, probably upon whose death it was returned to the sitter;[1] by descent to Captain David Anderson [1867-1944], Bourhouse, Dunbar, East Lothian [Scotland].[2] (Dott & Co., Edinburgh); sold 1900 to (P. & D. Colnaghi & Co., London); purchased October 1903 by Dr. Eissler [probably one of the brothers, Dr. Gottfried Eissler, 1862-1924, or Dr. Hermann Eissler, 1860-1953, both Vienna].[3] purchased c. 1924 by Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B.  Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, after purchase by funds of the Estate; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] David Anderson (1750-1825), of St. Germains, near Tranent, East Lothian, served in India with Warren Hastings, the first governor-general. The two became lifelong friends, and when they returned to England in 1785 they agreed to exchange portraits of each other. Anderson wrote to Hastings on 7 July 1790 that he had begun sitting to Raeburn (British Library Add. MS. 45,418:fol. 375). According to Kathleen Bliss, London, who was married to a direct descendant of David Anderson, the Raeburn portrait was returned to David Anderson either after Warren Hastings' impeachment trial, which lasted from 1784 to 1795, or after Hastings' death (letter, Mrs. Bliss to John Walker, NGA chief curator, 16 April 1947, in NGA curatorial files).\r\n\r\n      Hastings, in turn, had originally wanted Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint his portrait, but eventually commissioned Lemuel Abbot and sent the finished painting to Anderson in early 1797. Although John Hayes (in _British Paintings of the Sixteenth through Nineteenth Centuries. The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue_, Cambridge, England, 1992: 194) writes that the original Abbot portrait is now in the Victoria Memorial Museum in Calcutta, this is not the case. Abbot's first portrait of Hastings has remained in the possession of Anderson's descendants, and in 2003 was owned by David Anderson's great-great-great-granddaughter, Margaret Elizabeth Anderson Aynscough (Mrs. James Vernon Aynscough). The painting in Calcutta is one of at least eight copies made by Abbot after the original version, and Hastings also distributed copies by other artists (see correspondence in 2003 with Stephen Aynscough, in NGA curatorial files).\r\n\r\n[2] The provenance from Captain Anderson to Dr. Eissler is recorded in James Greig, _Sir Henry Raeburn, R.A._, London, 1911: 37.\r\n\r\n[3] Colnaghi's stock books (Roderic Thesiger, letter, 23 September 1969, in NGA curatorial files). The painting was not included in the sale of Gottfreid Eissler's estate in Vienna, 6-7 May 1925. There was also a sale of the Eissler collection at Pisko in Vienna in March 1908 that included a Raeburn, but it has not been identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Gottfried Winkler [1731-1795], Leipzig, by 1765.[1] Possibly with (Stéphane Bourgeois [Bourgeois Frères], Paris), in 1893/1894.[2] Rodolphe Kann [1845-1905], Paris, by 1898;[3] purchased 1907 with the entire Kann collection by  (Duveen Brothers, Inc., London, New York, and Paris);[4] sold to (F.

Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[6] inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Gerard Hoet, _Catalogus of Naamlyst van Schilderijen..._, 2 vols., The Hague, 1752, 2: 482, lists in the collection of H. Verschuring \"Een Oud Vrouwtje door Rembrandt. h.9d., br. 8d.\" The next painting listed was a pendant of an old man. Both paintings were then catalogued in the Winkler collection in 1768: Franz Wilhelm Kreuchauf, _Historische Erklaerungen der Gemaelde welche Herr Gottfried Winkler in Leipzig gesammelt_, Leipzig, 1798: nos. 495 and 496. Three years earlier, in 1765, the painting had been engraved in reverse by J.H. Bause, who for some reason dedicated his print to Johann Jacob Haid of Augsburg.  Bause also engraved the pendant (no. 496 from Winkler's catalogue); the description of the latter work is: \"Der Kopf eines betagten Mannes, mit dickaufgeschwollener Nase, kurzem Haare und Barte.\" This painting has disappeared but is listed in Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, _A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch Painters of the Seventeenth Century..._, trans. Edward G. Hawke, 8 vols., London, 1907-1927: 6(1916):no. 461. A photograph of Bause's engraving of the old man is in the NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n[2] Émile Michel, _Rembrandt: His Life, His Work, and His Time_, Trans. Florence Simmonds, 2 vols., New York, 1894: 2:238, gives the following description of a painting in the possession of \"M. Steph. Bourgeois\": \"Bust Portrait of a Woman, three-quarter to the front, small size.  About 1640. W[ood]. 7 7/8 x 6 1/2 inches.\" It is possible that this painting is in fact _Head of an Aged Woman_, and that Rodolphe Kann obtained it from Bourgeois, but so far no direct evidence has come to light that supports this theory. Bourgeois was the father-in-law of Leo Nardus, the dealer from whom Peter A.B. Widener received the painting in 1909. \r\n\r\n[3] Kann lent the painting to an exhibition in Amsterdam in 1898.\r\n\r\n[4] Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles:  reels 38 and 39, boxes 115-118, Stock books, Paris Ledger, and Sales Book for the Kann Collection.  \r\n\r\n[5] Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: reel 39, box 117, Paris Ledger, no. 1, Kann Collection.\r\n\r\n[6] Nardus received this painting and NGA’s _Head of Saint Matthew_ (1942.9.58) from Kleinberger in exchange for a portrait of a lady by Hans Memling. The same two paintings, along with ten others, were sent to Widener in early 1909, as replacements for a dozen paintings Nardus had sold to and then took back from the collector, after they were deemed by art historians of the day to be modern copies of “Old Masters.” \r\n\r\n     These two transactions involving Nardus are revealed in correspondence between Widener, his lawyer, John G. Johnson, Nardus, and Nardus’ assistant, Michel van Gelder, now in the John G. Johnson Collection Archives at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (box 5, folders 5 and 6, especially a letter, Michel van Gelder to John G. Johnson, 29 January 1909). The correspondence was found, transcribed, and kindly shared with the NGA by Jonathan Lopez (letter, sent with transcriptions, 24 April 2006, to Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., in NGA curatorial files).

Edward G. Hawke, 8 vols., London,  1907-1927: 4(1912):92, no. 285, possibly also 119, no. 367, 134, no. 418, 203, no. 643c). It seems that any or all of his four entries (nos. 285, 367, 418, and 643c) may contain information that relates to the _Forest Scene_, but these entries also contain additional and contradictory provenance listings, which must refer to at least one other painting. It nonetheless seems likely that before the _Forest Scene_ was acquired by Sir Hugh Hume Campbell, it was indeed owned by a member of the Conyngham family of Ireland, most probably the 2nd marquess, but also possibly his father, Henry, 3rd baron and 1st marquess Conyngham (1766-1832).\r\n\r\n[2] Gustav Friedrich Waagen, _Treasures of Art in Great Britain: Being an Account of the Chief Collections of Paintings, Drawings, Sculptures and Illuminated Mss., 3 vols., London, 1854-1857, supplement: 441-442. \r\n",

Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Gallery's painting is shown hanging above a fireplace in a 1670 picture, _Visitors at a Gallery of Paintings_, by Hieronymus Janssens (Musée Girodet, Montargis, France). See J.W. Niemeijer, \"De kunstverzameling van John Hope (1737-1784),\" _Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek_ 32 (1981): 179, no. 67. Van Dyck's painting was seen by Sir Joshua Reynolds in the Hope Cabinet in 1781 (see Sir Joshua Reynolds, \"A Journey to Flanders and Holland in the Year MDCCLXXXI,\" _The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Knight; late President of the Royal Academy_, 3 vols., London, 1798: 2:363). For a detailed account of the Hope Collection and the family history, see Niemeijer 1981.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] John Hope's estate, which was left to his three sons--Thomas [1769-1831], Adrian Elias [1772-1834] and Henry Philip [1774-1839]--was administered by the children's mother, Philippina Barbara van der Hoeven and their father's cousin, Henry Hope [1736-1811], who ran the family firm. After the mother's death in 1789, Henry Hope assumed control of the collection of paintings in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn 1791 the three sons received the division of their mother's estate and a partial division of their father's estate. However the collection of paintings was not divided, but remained in the estate. On June 18, 1794, Thomas Hope, having attained his legal majority, received his inheritance, but he received no part of the collection, which remained in his father's estate, and which was taken by Henry Hope to London in 1794 when he and other members of the family fled the invading French army (See: Martin G. Buist _At spes non fracta. Hope & Co. 1770-1815: Merchant Bankers and Diplomats at Work_, The Hague, 1974: 42-43, 49; Niemeijer 1981, 166-169).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn London Henry Hope was in possession of the collection. On December 17, 1795, he signed insurance lists of 'Pictures in the House No. 1 the corner of Harley Street, belonging to Mr. Henry Hope,\" (see J.W. Niemeijer, \"A Conversation Piece by Aert Schouman and the Founders of the Hope Collection,\" _Apollo_ 108 [September 1978]: 182-89). Included in the lists from catalogue B was \"Van Dijck...Ascension of the Virgin...400,\" see: Buist 1974, 491.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] It is not clear when, and for what reason, Henry Philip Hope became the sole heir of the paintings, but he seems to have inherited the collection no later than 1819. After Henry Hope's death in 1811, possession of the collection presumably went to Thomas Hope, with whom it remained because of Henry Philip Hope's peripatetic life (see: Niemeijer 1981, 169). Thomas kept most of the paintings in his two London residences; first at 2, Hanover Square and, after 1819, off Portland Place in Duchess Street, where he designed and built a special gallery to house the collection (see: David Watkin, _Thomas Hope 1769-1831 and the Neo-Classical Idea_, London, 1968: 93).  NGA 1942.9.88 was seen in Thomas Hope's Cabinet by C.M. Westmacott (_British Galleries of Painting and Sculpture_, London, 1824: 228).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] Henry Thomas Hope maintained the property and its collections on Duchess Street until 1851, when he moved to a new residence in Piccadilly (see: Niemeijer 1981, 170; and Ben Broos in _Great Dutch Paintings from America_, exh. cat., Mauritshuis, The Hague and The Fine Arts Museums, San Francisco, Zwolle, 1990: 422).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Lord Pelham-Clinton-Hope lent the painting to the South Kensington Museum from 1891-1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] Date as mentioned in Widener card files, kept in NGA Department of Curatorial Records. However, Edith Standen recorded in her notes, in NGA curatorial files, that the painting was bought by P.A.B. Widener in 1899. A third source, Statement of Date of Acquisition and Cost of Items (...) Conveying the Widener Collection to the National Gallery of Art, kept in office of the NGA's Secretary-General Counsel, also indicates that 1899 was the date of purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Widener, Elkins Park; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Giovanni Pietro Bellori (attr.), _Nota delli musei, librerie, gallerie et ornamenti di statue e pitture (...) di Roma_, Rome, 1664: 47, lists: \"Marchese Raggi. Palazzo sotto Campidoglio con gran numero di ritratti della famiglia Raggi, di mano di Antonio Van-Dych [sic] fatti con tutta la vivezza del colore, & diverse opere di altri Maestri.\" The \"Marchese\" mentioned here is presumably Tommaso Raggi (c. 1597-1679), a governor and senator of the Genoese Republic who, after having been accused of murder, was expelled from his home city in about 1627 and established himself in Rome, where he became \"generale delle galere\" to Pope Urban VIII in 1629, see Vittorio Spreti, _Enciclopedia storico-nobiliare italiana - famiglie nobili e titolate viventi riconosciute dal R.o governo d'Italia..._, 9 vols., Milan, 1928-1936: 5(1933-1935):582.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Carlo Giuseppe Ratti, _Instruzione di quanto può vedersi di più bello in Genova in pittura, scultura, ed architettura ecc... nuovamente ampliata e accresciuta_, Genoa, 1780: 193, mentions a \"Ritratto d'un Generale vestito d'armadura del Vandik\" in the collection of Francesco Maria Balbi in Genoa. Although Raggi's name is not noted in the reference, and Van Dyck painted a number of portraits of men in armor during his stay in Genoa, indirect evidence links this portrait with that of Raffaele Raggi. (Ratti, for example, could have been referring to Van Dyck's painting _A Man in Armour_ [now in the Cincinnati Art Museum, inv. no. 1927.393], which is known to have been in the Balbi Collection; see Christopher Brown, Hans Vlieghe, et al., _Van Dyck 1599-1641_, exh. cat., Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp, and Royal Academy of Arts, London, Antwerp and London, 1999: 190-191, no. 43.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIt is not certain how or when the Gallery's painting came to the Balbi family, but paintings were often transferred through marriage. Federica Lamera and Giorgio Pigafetta, eds., _Il Palazzo dell'Università di Genova. Il Collegio dei Gesuiti nella Strada dei Balbi_, Genoa, 1987: 42-43, publish a Balbi family tree, which lists two marriages that could be of particular interest regarding this painting: Battina Balbi with Gio. Antonio Raggio and Bianca Balbi with Gio. Batta Raggio. It is possible that the Raggi paintings may have come into the possession of the Balbi family through one of these marriages. It does seem possible that the Gallery's painting was no longer in the possession of the Raggi family in 1780, as Ratti 1780, 231, does not mention a portrait of a general or a prefect among the other paintings by Van Dyck in the Palazzo Raggi in the Via del Campo, home of Giulio Raggi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Piero Boccardo, \"Ritratti di collezionisti e committenti,\" in Susan Barnes, Piero Boccardo, et al., _Van Dyck e Genova.  Grande pittura e collezionismo_, exh. cat. Palazzo Ducale, Genoa, 1997: 30, notes that after the end of the Genoese oligarchy and the Napoleonic wars, economic crises led to the sale of many paintings, particularly to collectors in England. An 1894 Widener inventory entry indicates that the painting was acquired from the Balbi family by the father of the previous owner, Sir Walter Randolph Farquhar (\"A Gentleman in Armour from the Collection of an English nobleman whose father bought the painting from the Balby [sic] family of Genoa.\"), see P.A.B. Widener, \"Inventory of Paintings,\" unpublished ms., National Gallery of Art, Gallery Archives, Washington, D.C., n.d. [1890s]: unpaginated, no. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] In the 1894 sale of Farquhar's collection, the Van Dyck portrait is described as \"A General in Armour, with arms,\" that is, in terms comparable to those used by Ratti to describe the portrait in the collection of Francesco Maria Balbi, see note 2 above. In an annotated copy of the sales catalogue (in the Knoedler Library British Sales microfiche), the name \"Shepherd\" and the numbers \"73-10\" appear in handwriting next to the description of lot number 124. \"Shepherd\" is probably a reference to the firm of Shepherd Brothers in London, which seems to have been active from the early 1890s to the early c. 1910. The fact that the name \"Sedelmeyer\" also appears several times in this annotated sales catalogue indicates that he was also actively buying at the Farquhar sale.  Shepherd may have sold the painting directly to Sedelmeyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Date and source of Widener's acquisition according to Widener records in NGA curatorial files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(E.M. Hodgkins)[3] on joint account with (M. Knoedler and Co., New York); sold 1909 to Peter A.B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; inheritance from Estate of Peter A.B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park; gift 1942 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Carlo Giuseppe Ratti,  _Instruzione di quanto può vedersi di più bello in Genova in pittura, scultura, ed architettura ecc... nuovamente ampliata e accresciuta_, Genoa, 1780: 134, lists two paintings in the collection of Pier Francesco Grimaldi as representing \"Dama con un bimbo per mano,\" a description that could refer to NGA 1942.9.91. One of these two paintings is listed with a pendant of a man in armor (\"Uomo in armatura\"), now in South Brisbane, Queensland Art Gallery, listed in their catalogue as Marchese Filippo Spinola. Although Piero Boccardo, \"Ritratti di Genovesi di Rubens e di van Dyck: contesto e identificazioni,\" in Susan J. Barnes and Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., eds., _Van Dyck 350_, Hanover and Leiden, 1994: 101 note 8, relates the description in Ratti to the National Gallery's double portrait, he thinks it is more probable that the male portrait is a pendant to _A Genoese Noblewoman with her Child_ from the Cleveland Museum of Art. For this painting, see Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., Susan J. Barnes, et al., _Anthony van Dyck_, exh. cat., National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1990: no. 37, 178-179.\r\n\r\n[2] The painting was first recorded in this collection in 1801, as _Lady Brooke and Her Son_. However, David Buttery, \"George Romney and the Second Earl of Warwick,\" _Apollo_ 124 (August 1986): 108, 109 note 36, argues that it must have been in the collection by 1787 since it served as a model for George Romney's painting of _Lady Warwick and Her Children_, which was painted in that year. The Earl may have acquired it as early as 1775. Buttery quotes a letter written in that year by Richard Cumberland that refers to Van Dyck paintings in the Earl's collection. It is also possible, however, that the painting was still in Genoa in 1780. See note 1.\r\n\r\n[3] Hodgkins may have acquired NGA 1942.9.91 from the Earl of Warwick, since he is known to have acquired _Margareta Snyders_, now in The Frick Collection (09.1.42, New York), from the Warwick collection. Both paintings were then handled by M. Knoedler and Co. _Margareta Snyders_ was sold to Henry Clay Frick in 1909, the same year that Widener bought _A Genoese Noblewoman and Her Son_.

    "provenance": "Possibly Tommaso Puccini [1749-1811], Villa a Scornio, near Pistoia.[1] possibly (Sangiorgi, Rome), early 1900s.[2] Achillito Chiesa, Milan.[3] (Piero Tozzi [1882-1974], New York), by 1925 until at least 1927.[4] Percy S. Straus, New York, by 1932.[5] (Bachstitz Gallery, The Hague), by 1934.[6] (Duveen Brothers, Inc., London, New York, and Paris), by 1937;[7] sold 1940 to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, New York;[8] gift 1943 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In commentary on Filippo Lippi, Tommaso Puccini writes (\"Dialoghi sulle Vite del Vasari,\" Archive of the Gallerie Fiorentine, Florence, c. 1800, Ms. no. 46, fol. 199): \"Io possiedo di questo Autore un quadretto conservatissimo esprimente l'Annunziata...Genuflette davanti alla Vergine, assorta in contemplazione del S. Spirito che viene a deporla nel seno il Messia, bianco vestito, con un giglio in mano, un grazioso Angeletto che non tocca coi ginocchi il terreno, ma sta sull'ali sospeso. Il fondo rappresenta l'interno della Camera con una prospettiva intesa a meraviglia...\" (\"I possess by this author a very well preserved little picture representing the Annunciate...Kneeling before the Virgin, rapt in contemplation of the Holy Spirit who comes to place the Messiah in her womb, dressed in white, with a lily in his hand, a lovely little angel who does not touch the ground with his knees but floats on wings. The background represents the interior of a room with a perspective which is marvelously understood\"). Apart from the detail concerning the knees which do not touch the floor, the description is quite similar to the NGA painting, but it may refer, of course, to some other of Lippi's paintings on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The name \"S.  Giorgi\" is written on the back of a photograph of the painting belonging to the Biblioteca Berenson at Villa I Tatti near Florence and coming from Bernard Berenson's files, indicating the panel's earliest known location. This was Berenson's customary abbreviation for the name of the Roman dealer Sangiorgi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] The art collection of Achille Chiesa in Milan, inherited after his death by his son Achillito, was sold at the American Art Association Galleries in New York at various sales between 1925 and 1927. The NGA painting, however, which is not listed in the auction catalogues, must have been sold privately sometime earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] According to Odoardo H. Giglioli, \"Una pittura ignota di Fra Filippo Lippi,\" _BdA_, n.s. 6 (1925-1926): 553, the painting was brought to Florence for restoration. Records of the Florentine Soprintendenza dei Beni Artistici e Storici (_pratica_ no. 630 of 27 January 1925) show that the panel, belonging to the dealer Tozzi, entered Italy in January 1925 and left for New York in March 1927. No records concerning this painting have been discovered in The Tozzi Archive, housed in The Onassis Library for Hellenic and Roman Art, Department of Greek and Roman Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] See Berenson Berenson, _Italian Pictures of the Renaissance_, Oxford, 1932: 288. Possibly the painting passed through various hands before entering, sometime around 1930, the Straus collection. The annotation on Berenson's photograph, cited in note 2, also records the Florence dealer Albrighi as owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] The painting was illustrated in 1934, in a partially cleaned state, in an advertisement of the Bachstitz Gallery in the December issue of _The Burlington Magazine_ 65, xvi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] See Robert Oertel, _Fra Filippo Lippi_, Vienna, 1942: 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:263.

If the frescoes were in the Casa Rabia, on the Piazza San Sepolcro in Milan, the house passed out of the family about 1530, but the paintings remained in place since they were not removed until about 1800. Among the subsequent owners of the house were the Palletta and Silva families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The ownership of the frescoes by Cavaleri and Cernuschi, as well as other information about the provenance is discussed in detail by Luca Beltrami, _Luini, materiale de studio_, Milan, 1911: 188-198. Cavaleri was a Milanese lawyer who began collecting around 1845 and from 1870 on opened to the public what by then had come to be called the Cavaleri Museum. The owner hoped that the collection would be purchased by the city of Milan, but when negotiations fell through, he sold the entire collection to Cernuschi on 13 April 1873 (see Alessandra Mottola Molfino, \"Collezionismo e mercato artistico a Milano,\" in _Zenale e Leonardo. Tradizione e rinnovamento della pittura lombarda_, Milan, 1982: 247-248). Cernuschi was a Milanese emigrant to France, and as he otherwise collected mainly objects of Asian Art (see Caroline Gyss-Vermande, \"Cernuschi, Henri,\" in _Dictionary of Art_, 34 vols., New York, 1996: 6:345), it is likely he obtained his Italian paintings from the Cavaleri collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Charles Sedelmeyer, [catalogue], Paris, 1897: nos. 52-60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] _Gemälde-Sammlung des Herrn Rudolf Kann in Paris. 100 Photogravuren mit Text von Wilhelm Bode_, Vienna, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Fern Rusk Shapley, _Paintings from the Samuel H.

Hamilton [1886-1967], New York;[5] sold 1942 to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, New York;[6] gift 1943 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The altarpiece is cited as being on the main altar (erroneously, as a work of Andrea del Castagno) by Giovanni Cinelli in Francesco Bocchi, _Le bellezze della città di Firenze_, ed. Giovanni Cinelli, Florence, 1677 (originally 1591): 280. It was probably moved on the occasion of restoration work done in the church between 1712 and 1715 (see Walter and Elisabeth Paatz, _Die Kirchen von Florenz_, 6 vols., Frankfurt am Main, 1941: 2:607).\r\n\r\n[2] Cited as being there by Filippo Baldinucci, _Notizie dei professori del disegno da Cimbaue in qua_, 5 vols. (originally 6 vols.), ed. F. Ranalli, Florence, 1845-1847 (originally 1728): 3:95 n. 1.\r\n\r\n[3] The altarpiece was described there by both Giuseppe Richa, _Notizie istoriche delle chiese florentine_, 10 vols., Florence, 1754-1762: 10:294) and Vincenzo Follini and Modesto Rastrelli, _Firenze antica e moderna_, 8 vols., Florence, 1789-1802: 8:254). Among early writers, G. Lanzi (_Storia pittorica della Italia_, Bassano, 1795-1796: 1:58) is the only one who mentions the predella, which at that time must still have been attached to the main panel. That in 1827 the usually careful Rumohr, the first to read and transcribe the signature of Domenico Veneziano on the altarpiece, did not mention the predella, leads one to suppose that by this date it was no longer in the church. See Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, _Italienische Forschungen_, 3 vols., ed. by Julius Schlosser, Frankfurt am Main, 1920 (originally Berlin, 1827-1831): 387. In fact, Rumohr presumably saw the panel during his second stay in Italy, between 1816 and 1820. (See E. Sigismund, \"R.C.F. Freiherr von Rumohr,\" in _Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden Künstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart_, ed. Ulrich Thieme, Felix Becker, and Hans Vollmer, 37 vols., Liepzig, 1907-1950: 29[1935]:202.)\r\n\r\n[4] According to his own statements (see Bernard Berenson, _Abbozzo per un autoritratto_, Florence, 1949: 228-229), Berenson collected art works only for the furnishing and decoration of his house, and ceased purchasing toward the middle of the second decade of the twentieth century. The period in which he came into possession of NGA 1943.4.48 can therefore be placed between about 1900 (when he moved to Villa I Tatti near Florence) and about 1915. The 1913 date was supplied by Carl Strehlke (curator, Philadelphia Museum of Art; e-mail to David Brown, 7 April 2011, in NGA curatorial files), who kindly shared his research in Berenson records at I Tatti. In the files of temporary import licenses for which Berenson applied are both a receipt dated 24 July 1913, on printed stationary of A.L. Nicholson in London, for \"Picture on Panel / 'A Saint in the Wilderness' School of Fra Angelico,\" and Berenson's declaration to the Soprintendenza that he brought from London: \"Dipinto su tavola con cornice Fig. S. Giovannino nel deserto.\" Both these documents probably refer to the NGA painting. \r\n\r\n[5] See Nicky Mariano and Kenneth Clark, _Forty Years with Berenson_, New York, 1966: 18, who claim that it was Mary Berenson who gave the present, and the rectification by David Alan Brown, \"Berenson's Contribution to Scholarship, Taste, and Collecting,\" in _Berenson and the Connoisseurship of Italian Painting_, exh. cat., National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1979: 22-23. \r\n\r\n[6] Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:159-162.  Hamilton offered his painting to Samuel H. Kress in a letter dated May 1942 (copy in NGA curatorial files); the offer was accepted in the same year.

Wunderlich & Co., New York [later Kennedy Galleries]); sold January 1902 to John Howard Whittemore [d. 1910], Naugatuck, Connecticut; probably bequeathed to the J. H. Whittemore Company, Naugatuck, Connecticut, with life interest to his daughter, Miss Gertrude B. Whittemore [d. 1941], Naugatuck, Connecticut;[1] gift 1943 to NGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Andrew McLaren Young, Margaret F. MacDonald, and Robin Spencer, with the assistance of Hamish Miles, _The Paintings of James McNeil Whistler_, New Haven, 1980: 170, dates the transcation with Whittemore to 1900, based on a note by Kennedy in the New York Public Library. However, according to a letter (signed by Hermann Wunderlich) of 24 November 1934 from Kennedy & Co. to the J.H. Whittemore Company, the painting was purchased directly from the artist in May 1901 (recounted in letter of 7 April 1948 from Clarence E. Jones, Whittemore Co. treasurer, to James Lane, in NGA curatorial files).  In addition, the invoice for the sale from Wunderlich to Whittemore is dated 6 January 1902, with payment received 22 January (copy in NGA curtaorial files). The artist Edward Austin Abbey recommended the painting, as \"the property of a Mr. Whittemore of Naugatuck,\" to Isabella Stewart Gardner when it was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in early 1902 (letter of 30 January 1902, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, copy in NGA curatorial files). Another question in the records seems to be which \"Mr. Whittemore\" purchased the painting, John Howard Whittemore, or his son, Harris Whittemore.  Most of the records seem to point to John Howard Whittemore. The 1902 invoice was made out to \"J. H. Whittemore,\" and the loan of the painting to five exhibitions prior to John Whittemore's death in 1910 was credited to either \"John H. Whittemore\" or \"J.H. Whittemore.\" Although not explicitly documented, it seems that, as with _Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl_, John Howard Whittemore's daughter, Gertrude B. Whittemore, was given a life interest in the painting after it became owned by the J.H. Whittemore Company, a company formed after John Howard Whittemore's death. Miss Whittemore is credited as the owner of the painting in the six exhibitions to which it was lent prior to her death in 1941.  Despite this evidence, letters in NGA curatorial files from the Whittemore Company always discuss the painting as having been owned by Harris Whittemore, and the 1980 catalogue raisonné (p. 170), confuses the two Whittemore names, referring to \"J. Harris Whittemore\" at one point.",
